# HTML-Scraping-Challenge


## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News 

- Automated browsing (with Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup). 
- The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted. 
- The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structureâ€”specifically, a list of dictionaries. 

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data 

- The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Either Pandas or Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. The columns have the correct headings and data types.
- The data was analyzed to answer the following questions: 
- How many months exist on Mars? 
- How many Martian days' worth of data are there?
